== About me
I am currently an Applied Scientist at [https://www.amazon.com/ Amazon], where I focus on developing GenAI-based search and recommendation models and algorithms for both Amazon Search and Amazon Advertising. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Louisiana State University, advised by Dr. [http://csc.lsu.edu/~msun/ Mingxuan Sun].

At Amazon, my work spans both production and research:

1. Production Impact:
I’ve contributed to large-scale real-time and offline systems, including training a generative sequential recommendation LLM with semantic IDs, delivering a generation-augmented retrieval system for product recommendation, and developing a contextual multi-objective embedding–based retrieval model. These efforts have collectively driven over \$500M in annualized sponsored products advertising revenue and over \$700M in annualized order product sales (OPS).

2. Research Contributions:
I serve as the primary point of contact (POC) for several patent and research initiatives and have published multiple papers at both external academic conferences and Amazon's internal research venues.

#I'm currently working at [https://www.amazon.com/ Amazon] as an Applied Scientist. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Louisiana State University, under the guidance of Dr. [http://csc.lsu.edu/~msun/ Mingxuan Sun]. My research focuses on developing computationally efficient machine learning as well as deep learning models and algorithms, with applications in recommender systems, time-series analysis, computer vision, computer graphics, natural language processing, and fairness.
